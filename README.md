About Me: 
Technology is at the forefront of solving some of the biggest problems in this world and I want to be a part of it. As early as I could remember I have always been passionate about technology and design. Around age 12, shortly after my family brought home our first home computer, I remember going to the book store to buy my very first programming book "HTML: A beginners guide by Wendy Willard". I read that book from cover to cover jumpstarting my career in the web-dev at an early age. Since then I have improved my skills dramatically with not just coding, but also designing for the web as well. This is a lifelong journey of growth for me and I look forward to adding more value to this world as I continue to progress.
